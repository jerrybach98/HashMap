# Data structure practice:
Hashmap implementation starting with 16 buckets. Hash map does not preserve insertion order. Handles collisions with a linear approach and open addressing. Doubles in size when the load factor reaches .75. 

# Further Optimizations: 
- Search hashmap starting from index location instead of beginning
- Storing buckets as nodes also allows a linked list approach for collisions
